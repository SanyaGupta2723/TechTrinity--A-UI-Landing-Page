TechTrinity (By Sanya) is a professional and responsive landing page designed to offer digital solutions for businesses, built using React, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases a modern web interface that emphasizes clean design, smooth user experience, and responsive layout. The frontend is developed using React.js, enabling the application to be modular, fast, and dynamic, while HTML5 and JSX structure the content. Tailwind CSS has been used for rapid styling with a utility-first approach, allowing for quick layout adjustments and consistent design patterns. The landing page includes multiple key sections like navigation, features, testimonials, pricing, and a contact form. It features CTA buttons such as "Get Started" and "Learn More," along with a working contact form prefilled with demo details. The site is served locally (on port 5173), likely using a tool like Vite or React Scripts for development. The overall theme is business-oriented, aiming to attract potential clients with innovative tech-driven services and a polished visual identity under the brand name "TechTrinity."
